Two squares game. This game is played on a board of 4 x 4 squares. Two players take turns; each of them takes turn to place a rectangle (that covers two squares) on the board, covering any 2 squares. Only one rectangle can be on a square. A square cannot be covered twice. The last player who can place a card on the board is the winner.
